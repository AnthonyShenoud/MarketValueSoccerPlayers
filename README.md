# MarketValueSoccerPlayers

Abstract- The realm of soccer player valuation constitutes a landscape characterized by enormous spending, fueled by the pursuit of top talent. However, organizations are cursed by the problem of biased player reputations, impeding accurate assessments of a playerâ€™s worth. This study navigates this intricate terrain by analyzing the relationship between individual attributes, particularly technical skills, and a player's market value. Addressing the challenge of bias, this research dissects the specific skills and statistics that influence a player's worth, while considering the impact of physical, mental, and technical attributes. To form the groundwork, data cleaning techniques sourced from the official FIFA website are employed including currency alignment, duplicate detection, and domain knowledge. Next, correlation analyses unveil the most pivotal attributes, followed by outlier detection mechanisms ensuring data integrity. Finally, with regression methodologies and Python's scikit-learn, the study culminates in an evaluative model that predicts player valuation, emphasizing technical skills as prime indicators of worth. The results of this study detail an accurate estimation of player values based solely on technical prowess, offering insights into market efficiency, risk assessment precision, and data-driven player contract negotiations. This study offers a glimpse into the transformative potential of skill-centric valuations in sports, highlighting their implications in revolutionizing the industry.
